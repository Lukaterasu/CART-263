    <p>1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</p> 
    <p>2. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>
    <p>3. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. </p>
    <p>4. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. </p>
    <p>5. God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p>
    <p>6. And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”</p>
    <p>7. So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.</p> 
    <p>8. God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</p>
    <p>9. And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.</p>
    <p>10. God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.</p>
